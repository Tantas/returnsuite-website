# Additional Rent

## How to calculate a property's Additional Rent

Additional Rent encompasses most of the remaining rental income and
recoveries specified in a lease agreement that are not part of the fixed
Base Rent. Additional Rent includes variable, contingent, or
reimbursable amounts that may fluctuate based on external factors,
tenant performance, or actual expenses incurred. While often predictable
to some degree, the exact amounts of Additional Rent is not certain
until they occur or are calculated.

The three main types of Additional Rents and their Free Rent counterpart
are: Expense Recoveries, CPI Increases and Miscellaneous Rent.

### Expense Recoveries

Expense Recoveries are additional charges to tenants designed to
reimburse the landlord for certain operating costs associated with
the property. These typically include items such as utilities,
property taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (CAM)
expenses. The amount charged is often proportional to the tenant's
occupied space and is outlined in the lease agreement. For example,
a tenant occupying 25% of a building might be responsible for 25% of
the recoverable expenses.

Corresponding to expense recoveries are free expense recoveries. They are a specific concession where a tenant is
not required to pay some or all of the typical expense recoveries
for a specified period during their lease term. This concession is
often used as an incentive for new tenants or during lease renewals.
The value of Free Expense Recoveries is calculated as the amount of
expense recoveries that would have been collected during the free
period based on the lease terms and the actual expenses incurred.

Both Expense Recoveries and Free Expense Recoveries are considered
Additional Rent because they are separate from and in addition to
the Base Rent, and their exact amounts may vary based on actual
expenses incurred by the property.

### CPI increases

CPI Increases are adjustments to rental rates tied to changes in the
Consumer Price Index, designed to maintain the real value of rent
over time in the face of inflation. For example, a lease may set the
Base Rent as $30 per square foot per year plus the CPI from the
previous year, beginning the second of the lease.

Free CPI Increases are a specific concession where a tenant is not
required to pay the CPI Increase(s) for a specified period during
their lease term. The value of Free CPI Increases is the amount of
CPI Increases that would have been collected during the Free CPI
Increases period identified in the lease terms.

While CPI Increases modify the amount of Base Rent paid and are
sometimes classified as a type of Base Rent, ReturnSuite considers
CPI Increases a form of Additional Rent. By classifying CPI
Increases as Additional Rent, there is a clear distinction between
fixed, predetermined rental income and variable, market-driven
adjustments. We believe that this classification provides more
transparent financial reporting, allows for more accurate
forecasting, and aligns with modern accounting standards and best
practices in real estate financial analysis.

### Miscellaneous Rent

Miscellaneous Rent refers to Additional Rent specified in a lease
agreement that doesn't fall under standard categories like Base
Rent, Expense Recoveries, or CPI Increases. It can be fixed or
variable and is typically charged in addition to Base Rent.

Miscellaneous Rent is often unique to specific tenant needs or
property features. If a Miscellaneous Rent is common among multiple
tenants or properties, it may make more sense to classify the rent
as Other Tenant Revenue.

Free Miscellaneous Rent is a concession where a tenant is not
required to pay some or all of the Miscellaneous Rent for a
specified period during their lease term. The value of Free
Miscellaneous Rent is calculated as the amount of Miscellaneous Rent
that would have been collected during the free period based on the
lease terms.

As with other forms of Additional Rent, they are separate from and
in addition to the Base Rent.

### Example

Following our previous example, letâ€™s say that all three units were
required to pay $300 in Expense Recoveries, although Unit B was given
$100 in Free Expense Recoveries and Unit C remains vacant (so there are
no recoveries).

Unit A had an annual CPI Increase in their lease, however the year we
are analyzing they also had a Free CPI Increase period. The CPI Increase
for the year would have been 5%. Also, the tenant in Unit B also had a
clause in their lease to pay $50 for special access to the roof for
their wireless equipment.

What would the Additional Rent look like?
