# Other Tenant Revenue

## What is included in other tenant revenue

Other Tenant Revenues are the non-rent based sources of income which can
be attributed to specific tenants. While the various types of Other
Tenant Revenue are uncommon, to qualify as an item on the NOI Statement,
the revenue needs to be a recurring source of incomeâ€“so if the item
being considered is a one-time boost to income, it should not be
categorized as Other Tenant Revenue.

Income sources classified as Other Tenant Revenue include:

### Incentive Recoveries

An incentive recovery is a provision in a lease agreement that
allows the landlord to recover the value of upfront incentives given
to a tenant, typically if the tenant defaults on the lease or
terminates it early. For example, if a tenant receives a $10,000
incentive for a 5-year lease but leaves after 2 years, they might
need to repay 60% of the incentive.

### Non-Refundable Deposits

A non-refundable deposit is a sum of money paid by a tenant to a
landlord that the landlord keeps regardless of whether the lease is
executed or completed. An example of a Non-Refundable Deposit is
during the early stage of a lease negotiation, a landlord may
require one as compensation for taking a property off the market
without a signed lease.

### Earned Interest on Deposits

Security Deposits are often held in interest earning accounts.
Depending on the terms of the lease and potentially the jurisdiction
the interest can be payable to either to the landlord or the tenant.
Earned Deposit Interest is interest earned by the landlord.

### Example

Continuing with our example, it turns out the previous tenant in Unit C
exited their four-year lease after two years. As part of their exit
agreement, they reimbursed the landlord half of their $500 Free Base
Rent incentive. The tenant in Unit A paid a $75 Non-Refundable Deposit
prior to signing their lease. The Tenant in Unit B has a $500 deposit,
earning 5% interest per year ($25) payable to the landlord.

What would the Other Tenant Revenues look like for each of the units and
the property as a whole?
