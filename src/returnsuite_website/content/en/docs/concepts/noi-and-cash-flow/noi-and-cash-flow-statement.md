# NOI and the Cash Flow Statement

## Learn how NOI is related to cash flow

The NOI Statement outlines the operating revenues and expenses of
a property, but it doesn’t factor in Capital Expenses or Financing–these
categories are itemized in the Cash Flow Statement (the next chapter of
the course).

The Cash Flow Statement includes all the items in the NOI Statement but
also includes a section for Capital Expenditures and a section for
Financing Activities–so the NOI Statement is the starting point of a
Cash Flow Statement.

In real estate, there will often be reference to expenses occurring
“above or below the line”. The line that is being referred to is the
NOI line in the Cash Flow Statement. Because so many of the valuation
techniques involve NOI in their calculations, the distinction of items
falling above or below the line can be quite significant. Properly
categorizing expenses above or below the line is a key aspect of
developing a realistic financial model of a property.
