# Market and Potential Base Rent

## How to calculate potential base rent

Potential Base Rent is the difference between Market Base Rent and
Excess (or Deficit) Base Rent. It provides a picture of a property's
income potential. This calculation considers both current market rates
and existing lease agreements, providing a crucial tool for informed
financial analysis.

### Market base rent

The Market Base Rent line is the starting point of both a NOI Statement
and a Cash Flow Statement is Market Base Rent–the potential base rent
the landlord could expect if the property was fully leased out at the
current market base rent at the chosen time period. This amount ignores
current lease contracts–it simply answers the theoretical question,
“What is the total base rent we could expect to earn if this property
was fully leased at today's market base rent?”.

### Excess (deficit) base rent

The Excess (or Deficit) Base Rent is the difference between the Market
Base Rent and the Base Rent of the leased spaces. Unleashed spaces have
neither an Excess nor Deficit Base Rent.

For example if a space was leased for a Base Rent of $10,000 per month
and the Market Base Rent was $9,000 (the market decreased since the
lease was signed), the Excess Base Rent would be $1,000. If the Base
Rent was $9,000 and the Market Base Rent was $10,000, the space would
have a Deficit Base Rent of $1,000.

### Potential Base Rent

Potential Base Rent is the maximum amount of Base Rent a landlord can
expect to earn given the leases in place. It is also equal to the sum of
the Market Base Rent and the Excess (Deficit) Base Rent

For unleased spaces, the Potential Base Rent is the Market Base Rent and
for leased spaces it is the Base Rent in the lease contract.

### Example

Let’s say we have a property with three units, each with a Market Base
Rent of <b class="font-semibold">$1,000</b>. <var>Unit A</var> is leased for <b class="font-semibold">$800</b>, <var>Unit B</var> is leased for <b class="font-semibold">$1,100</b>
and <var>Unit C</var> is empty. What is the <b class="font-semibold">Excess (Deficit) Base Rent</b> and
<b class="font-semibold">Potential Base Rent</b> for each unit and for the property as a whole?
