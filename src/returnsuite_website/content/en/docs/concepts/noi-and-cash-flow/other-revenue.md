# Other Revenues

## What income should be categorized as other revenues

Other Revenues include all the other sources of property income such as
Parking, Signage, Vending Machines and Events. These revenues may be
indirectly driven by tenants, but are not part of the main lease.

For example, the employees of a tenant may individually rent parking, or
a tenant may pay for parking on their employees behalf, but parking
revenue should be categorized as Other Revenue if parking isn’t
specifically outlined in their lease.

Even if the lease does include items like Parking or Signage, it is
preferable to identify the value of each component separately–this will
provide more transparency and reduce the risk of inadvertently
over-inflate the rental value of leased space.

For example if the Market Rent of a unit was $10,000 and the value of
parking that came with the lease was $1,000, wrapping the total value of
$11,000 into the Net Operating Income Statement would leave readers with
the impression that the unit was earning an Excess Rent of $1,000.

### Example

Continuing with our same example property, let’s say that the property
earned $400 in parking revenue, $125 from the Vending Machines and an
additional $100 from Special Events.

What would the Other Revenues section of the NOI Statement look like?
