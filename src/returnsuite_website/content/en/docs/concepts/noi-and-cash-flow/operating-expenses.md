# Operating Expenses

## How real estate operating expenses affect the NOI statement

Operating Expenses are the periodic expenditures required to operate and
maintain a property such as property maintenance, utilities and real
estate taxes. Because the NOI Statement is a display of the operating
profitability of a property, it is important that Capital Expenditures
(which are often large and sporadic) and Debt Financing (like interest
payments) are not classified as Operating Expenses.

Many operating expenses vary with the level of occupancy (variable
expenses) while others occur whether the property is occupied or vacant
(fixed expenses). Quite often operating expenses have both a variable
and fixed component.

For example, insurance is generally considered a fully fixed expense
(100%) while janitorial may be a fully variable expense (0%) while an
expense like electricity costs may be 25% fixed (and therefore 75%
variable).
