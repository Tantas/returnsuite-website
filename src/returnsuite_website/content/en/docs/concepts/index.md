# Valuation Concepts

## About this course

The goal of this course is to augment your first-hand knowledge about your
properties and local market with a first principles approach. This will help you
develop the best financial models for your properties regardless of the tools
you decide to use.

Each section of the course covers its associated real estate and finance
concepts, along with examples and exercises to reinforce the concept. The
exercises require the use of either a pen and paper or spreadsheets to solve.

Similar to learning accounting by hand, software packages provide easy-to-use
interfaces to manage a business on a day-to-day basis once the underlying
concepts are understood. ReturnSuite, along with other software providers,
provide a similar experience.

ReturnSuiteâ€™s mission is to provide you with both the mental tools and
intuitive software that will allow you to convert potential investment
opportunities into Investment Valuations with a full understanding of the risks
and returns.
