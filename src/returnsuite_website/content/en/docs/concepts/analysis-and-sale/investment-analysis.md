## Choosing Discount Rates

The final step of building a financial model is choosing a
<a href="#">Discount Rate</a>–the Cost of Capital or Hurdle Rate that an
investor requires to earn on similar types of investments when factoring
in all the forms of risk.

Discount Rates are applied to the <a href="#">entire set of cash flows</a>
over the life of the investment–and are not just applied to the
Reversionary Value.

<!-- TODO: Figure -->

Prior to choosing a Discount Rate, it is important to keep in mind the
purpose of the financial model. Is the model an Investment Valuation for
a specific investor or is it a Market Valuation for the general market?
The answer to this question will determine who’s Discount Rate your
analysis will be using.

Determining the Discount Rate requires two pieces of information–the
Nominal Annual Discount Rates and the Compounding Frequency.

### Choosing Discount Rates

Adding debt to a real estate investment may increase equity returns,
but it also increases the risk of the investment. Therefore as leverage
is added to a real estate investment, the Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate
should also increase.

Many ReturnSuite reports will show both leveraged and unleveraged returns,
which provides a more comprehensive view of an investment's performance
and potential–allowing investors to make more informed decisions based
on their risk tolerance, return expectations, and available financing
options. This is particularly useful in real estate which often has the
ability to take on significant debt.

To account for the risk that leverage adds, many investors use two
different Discount Rates which are both used in ReturnSuite:

1. <b>Unlevered Discount Rate</b> - the Nominal Discount Rate the
        investor(s) would expect without the use of debt financing, and
2. <b>Levered Discount Rate</b> - the Nominal Discount Rate the investor(s)
        would expect when factoring in the additional risk from the use of
        debt financing.

### Compounding Frequency

ReturnSuite users are entering in the Nominal Annual Discount Rates,
      which do not account for compounding. To factor in the effect of
      compounding a Compounding Frequency needs to be entered.
