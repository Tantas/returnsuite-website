## Summary of the key math concepts used in finance

Last updated November 15, 2024

Financial analysts look at an asset as a series of cash flows that will
happen in the future, including the cash that is expected to flow from the
eventual sale of the asset. The fundamental question these analysts are
trying to answer is, ‘How much is the future set of cash flows worth
today?’ In this section we are going to go over a handful of economic
concepts and mathematical tools that help to answer this question.

Underlying everything is the <b>Time Value of Money</b>–the idea that
financial benefits available today are more valuable than equivalent
benefits in the future. This is because money we forgo today can be
invested and returned to us with interest at a later date, so a dollar
in the hand today is worth more than a dollar someone is going to hand
you a year from now.

The Time Value of Money means that for each cash flow, we need to know not
only an amount (ex. $1,000) but also a time (ex. $1,000 a year into the
future).

To distinguish between money or value today and at some point in the future
we use the terms <b>Present Value</b> (the value to someone today if they
expect to receive future cash flows) and <b>Future Value</b> (the value at
some point in the future of those same cash flows). Much of finance and
financial analysis involves sliding our perspective either forwards or
backwards in time so a series of cash flows can be consolidated into a
single number. Most often it means converting Future Value cash flows
(either positive or negative) to Present Values so they can be totalled
and give us a <b>Net Present Value</b>.

A <b>Discount Rate</b> (or the Cost of Capital) is the change in value
that happens when you  convert a cash flow from one point in time to
another–whether it’s being converted from a Future Value to a Present
Value, a Present Value to a Future Value or even from one Future Value to
another Future Value.

In this course, we will look at <b>Perpetuities</b> and the
<b>Gordon Growth Model</b>, which is the math we need to value a
continuous, never-ending set of cash flows. Mastering these techniques is
crucial if you want to assess the worth of long-term assets like property.

We will also cover the concept of <b>Expected Value</b>, a statistical
measure that forecasts the weighted average financial results from
different investment scenarios, taking into account how likely each
scenario is. This is a valuable tool as there is often uncertainty about
exactly what will happen in the future. Will a tenant renew their lease,
or will their unit be placed back on the market? Expected Values allows
us to factor this uncertainty into our modeling.
