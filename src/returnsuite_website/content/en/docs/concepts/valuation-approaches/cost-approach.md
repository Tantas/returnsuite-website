# The Cost Approach

## How to determine the value of real estate using the Cost Approach

The Cost Approach bases value on the costs required to replace or
reproduce an asset, minus any depreciation. The idea behind this approach
is the principle of substitution—that a rational investor would not pay
more for an asset than the cost to obtain an asset of equal utility,
whether by purchase or by construction.

The Cost Approach is most often used when there is a lack of comparable
market data or an asset is so new, unique, or specialized that the main
question around value is around the replacement costs. The Cost Approach
is also often used for Insurance or by tax authorities, where the cost of
replacing an asset is more relevant.

A non-real estate example of the Cost Approach is a custom piece of
machinery that is critical to a manufacturing process at a factory–there
is no active market for the machinery and its income generating potential
can’t be separated from the entire factory, so the best way to determine
the value of the machinery is to start with it’s current replacement cost
and make adjustments for its current level of depreciation.

For real estate, it involves calculating what it would cost to build a
similar property from scratch, then adjusting for obsolescence and land
value. The approach will often be used for special-purpose assets like
public infrastructure (roads, bridges, ports, etc.). In the private
sector, the Cost Approach will be used for specialized owner-occupied
properties with no comparable sales or leasing market data. For investment
properties, the Cost Approach is often used for partially complete or
brand new construction prior to income generation.
