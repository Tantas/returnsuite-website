# Summary of real estate valuation methods

## The main categories of real estate valuation methods and how they are used

The three high level approaches for valuation of real estate assets are
the Market, Cost and Income Approaches.

The Market Approach is based on the assumption that recent transactions
in the market are the best indicator of value–if similar assets have sold
for X, the asset being valued must be worth X as well. The Market Approach
is especially useful in markets with many transactions of similar assets.

The Cost Approach is based on the principle of substitution–that an asset
is worth what it would cost to replace it today, minus any depreciation.
An investor would not pay more than X for an asset if they obtain an
asset of equal utility for X. The Cost Approach is most often used when
there is a lack of comparable market data or an asset is so new, unique,
or specialized that the main question around value is around the
replacement costs.

The Income Approach is the main focus for real estate investors and is
based on the idea that an asset is worth the expected future cash flows
that the asset will generate, accounting for the riskiness of those cash
flows compared to other investment options. An investor will pay X for
an asset if other investment options producing similar cash flows with
similar risk profiles are also trading at X.

There are four methods within the Income Approach we cover in this
course and with ReturnSuite:

1. The **Standard method of Direct Capitalization** is essentially a
   perpetuity–discounting the NOI of a property by comparable
   Capitalization Rates.

2. The **Tiered method of Direct Capitalization** is the sum of
   multiple perpetuities–discounting different NOI components by
   different Capitalization Rates and then summing up the results.

3. The **Top Slice method** is also the sum of multiple perpetuities,
   but rather than dividing the property into spaces and discounting the
   independent NOIs, the NOIs are divided with each component of NOI
   being discounted by an appropriate Capitalization Rate.

4. The <b>Discounted Cash Flow method</b> is the sum of two parts. First
   an Analysis Period is chosen and the cash flows during that period are
   discounted at a desired Discount Rate to the Present Value. Secondly
   Reversionary Value is calculated using one of the Direct
   Capitalization methods, which is then also discounted at a desired
   Discount Rate to the Present Value. These two components are added
   together to determine the value.
