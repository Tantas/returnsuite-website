# Overview

## What is the best way to value a real estate asset?

It’s easy to become overly focused on “real estate” within “real estate
valuation”, but real estate is just one of many asset classes that needs
to be regularly valued. Even for businesses whose main activity is
developing or holding property, the value of real estate is just a
component of the business information required for financial reporting.

So if we were to take a wider view of the question, what is the best way
to value any asset (or liability)?

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is an independent,
private-sector body that develops and publishes the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are designed to be a global
language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable
and comparable across international boundaries.

A few major economies have their own accounting standards, notably the
United States, Japan, China and India, but their accounting standards are
all committed to converging with the IFRS in the future.

The IFRS identifies three valuation techniques which can be used to
determine the Fair Value of an asset: the Market Approach, the Cost
Approach and the Income Approach. Non-coincidentally, these three
techniques closely mirror the main evaluation approaches in real estate.

Each of the approaches value an asset by answering a slightly different
question.

  <li>Income Approach–what would an investor pay for the cash flow produced by this asset?</li>
  <li>Cost Approach–what would this cost to reproduce?</li>
  <li>Market Approach–what do similar assets sell for?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at each approach in more detail.</p>
