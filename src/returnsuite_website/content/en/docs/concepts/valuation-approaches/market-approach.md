# The Market Approach

## How to determine the value of real estate using the Market Approach

In broad terms, the Market Approach estimates value by comparing the asset
to similar assets that have been sold recently. This process is based on
the assumption that the market provides the best indicator of an asset's
value. This approach is useful when there are a lot of transactions of
relatively similar assets.

The Market Approach is ideal for financial assets such as stocks or
bonds–what is the value of a share in a widely traded company like
Coca-Cola? The most recent trading price on the stock market.

This makes valuation relatively simple–the value of a portfolio of
stocks and bonds is easy to calculate and can be updated to the second.

A non-financial example would be the used car market–it’s possible to
determine a fairly accurate estimate of the sale price of a used car by
comparing it to the previous sales of other cars of the same make, model,
year, mileage and condition in your geographic region.

In real estate, the Market Approach is often called a Comparative Market
Analysis (CMA) and is most commonly used in residential real estate. For
example, to determine the Market Value of a three-bedroom, two-bathroom
house, a valuer will find recent sales of similar houses in the same
neighborhood–often called comparables or ‘comps’. The valuer will make
adjustments for any slight differences in the comps between the house
being valued to arrive at an estimated Market Value for the subject
property.
