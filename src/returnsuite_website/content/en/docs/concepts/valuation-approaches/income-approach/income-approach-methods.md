# Income Approach Methods

## A comprehensive look at the most common Income Approach Methods

While the Market, Cost and Income approaches are all separate methods of
valuing assets, they are also all interrelated–the Cost Approach relies
on the Market Approach to determine the land value component and the
Income Approach relies on the Market Approach for determining
Capitalization Rates.

The approaches also can’t differ too much. If the values determined by
either the Market or Income Approaches remain well above the CostApproach
for any length of time, new supply will enter the market, pushing the
Market and Income Approach values downwards (or in a hot enough
construction market, Cost Approaches upwards).

The bulk of this course is focused on the various methods within the
Income Approach, so let’s take a closer look at the Valuation Family Tree
and see how the Income Approach can be further subdivided.

We'll focus on four of the seven valuation methods within the Income
Approach that are appropriate for real estate:

  <li>The Standard method of Direct Capitalization</li>
  <li>The Tiered method of Direct Capitalization</li>
  <li>The Top Slice method</li>
  <li>Discounted Cash Flow</li>
</ol>

Each of these valuation techniques are appropriate in different
situations, but they all rely on the same fundamental principles, but
just applied in slightly different ways.
