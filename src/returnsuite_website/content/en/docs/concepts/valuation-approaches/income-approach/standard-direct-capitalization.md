# Standard Direct Capitalization

## How to calculate real estate values using the Standard Direct Capitalization method

The Standard method of Direct Capitalization is one of the most commonly
used methods of the Income Approach in real estate valuation. The
technique is essentially a real estate version of the value of a
Perpetuity and works well for properties that have a stable and
predictable cash flow.

Rather than using a formula for a perpetuity, the approach substitutes
the annual Net Operating Income (NOI) in for Cash Flow and the
Capitalization Rate in for the Discount Rate.

In ReturnSuite, the date in which the valuation is being made is referred
to as the End Date, but it is also called a Valuation Date. End Dates are
specific dates (ie. January 1st, 2022), however NOIs are windows of time
which are generally assumed to be one year in length
(ie. January 1st,2022 to December 31st, 2022).

There are three methods within the Standard Direct Capitalization
approach with the difference being which period of NOI is being
capitalized. The most common method is to capitalize the NOI expected
12 months after the End Date, however there are three options:

<ol>
  <li><b>Forward 12-Months</b> - the total forecasted NOI in the year after the End Date (most common method)</li>
  <li><b>Trailing 12-Months</b> - the total NOI in the year leading up to the End Date</li>
  <li><b>Average 24-Months</b> - the one-year average NOI for 12 months before and after the End Date.</li>
</ol>

### Exercise

Let’s say you have a property that 12 months ago had a quarterly NOI of
$200,000. Since that time, the NOI has been growing at a rate of 0.75%
per quarter, which is expected to continue into the future. The
Capitalization Rates for similar properties is 6.25%.

Use the attached Worksheet for the following tasks.

TODO: Download Spreadsheet

#### Task

Using the worksheet, calculate the value of the property using the
Standard Direct Capitalization approach using each of the three different
methods.

#### Hint

To calculate the NOIs for each of the methods:

<ul>
  <li>The NOI for the Forward 12-months method is the sum of the NOI’s from Quarters 5 to 8</li>
  <li>The NOI for the Trailing 12-months method is the sum of the NOI’s from Quarter’s 1 to 4</li>
  <li>The NOI for the Average 24-months method is the average of the two NOI’s–the first being the NOI’s from Quarter’s 1 to 4 and the second being the NOI’s from Quarters 5 to 8. An alternative approach is to sum the NOI’s from Quarters 1 to 8 and divide the result by 2.</li>
</ul>

#### Solution

Your answers should produce the following Valuations: TODO: Add the variations.

#### Task 2

Using the same spreadsheet, calculate the valuations for the property for
the beginning of Quarter 9. Let’s also assume that the forecasted
Capitalization Rate in Quarter 9 will have decreased to 6.00%.

#### Hint

To calculate the NOIs for each of the methods:

<ul>
  <li>The NOI for the Forward 12-months approach is the sum of the NOI’s from Quarters 9 to 12</li>
  <li>The NOI for the Trailing 12-months approach is the sum of the NOI’s from Quarter’s 5 to 8</li>
  <li>The NOI for the Average 24-months approach is the average of the two NOI’s–the first being the NOI’s from Quarter’s 5 to 8 and the second being the NOI’s from Quarters 9 to 12. An alternative approach is to sum the NOI’s from Quarters 5 to 12 and divide the result by 2.</li>
</ul>

#### Solution

Your answers should produce the following Valuations:
