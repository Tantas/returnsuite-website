## How to import and export the property model and connect to other apps

ReturnSuite believes that your data belongs to you. The platform can expose all
data entered through the UI using secure API endpoints. There are currently two
available options for importing and exporting your data.

### ReturnSuite model import

The ReturnSuite property model import integration allows models to be uploaded
from the clipboard as JSON or YAML files in the ReturnSuite data format or
uploaded as JSON and YAML files. Any report exported to the XLSX file format
with the generated assumptions tab can be uploaded as well. The same import
function exists when creating a new property in app.

### ReturnSuite model export

The ReturnSuite property model export integration allows models to be downloaded
to JSON, YAML or XLSX. These can be uploaded via the import integration or when
creating a new property.
