# External Links

## Specifying the listing location, model sources and related information

Property external links exist to allow reference material to be attached to the
property. These links can reference listings, model reference sources and
related documents for the property, such as zoning, legal and environmental
reports.

### Adding an external link

Create a new external link by selecting the Add external link button and
inputting a title and url. External links can be organized using the drag icon
on the top left and removed using the trash icon on the top right. They must be
expanded to edit the content.

The changes must be saved to take effect.


#### External link title

The title of the url as input. This will be the name of the link.
Collapse the entry to see how the link will be displayed.


#### External link description

An optional description of the external link for internal use.


#### External link url

The url of the link starting from https://. It is recommended that secure links
(https) are used whenever possible. The url can point to private or protected
sources, though only users with access to the external systems will be able to
view the page.
