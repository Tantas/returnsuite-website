# Portfolio Groups

## Add tags to group properties into portfolios dynamically

The portfolio groups form allows tags to be added to a property to improve
property identification, search and can be used to group properties into
portfolios based on shared tags.

### Adding a portfolio group

Create a new portfolio group by selecting the Add button and inputting the
required name. Groups found on other properties in the account will be present
in the related groups sections. Pressing the plus button on a related group will
add it to the property. Renaming any group will only impact the active property
and must be repeated for each property the new name should apply.

Portfolio groups can be reordered using the drag icon on the top right of each
entry. The order the selected groups appear is the order the group will appear
in the properties view. Remove a group using the trash icon on the top right of
each entry.

The changes must be saved to take effect.


#### Portfolio group name

A short, descriptive name of the grouping category.


#### Portfolio group description

An optional description of the group for internal use.
