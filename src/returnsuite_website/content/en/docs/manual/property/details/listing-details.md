# Property listing details

## Update the property listing details

### Adding and removing the listing details

### Summary information


#### Property type

The type of property based on its use and income. This is exclusively a listing
identifier and does not restrict how the property is modeled.

##### Type options:

Office
:   An office building with made up primarily of traditional leases.

Light Industrial
:   A property of traditional leases used in manufacturing.

Retail
:   A property primary made up of traditional leases with additional revenues
    coming from a percentage of tenant sales.

    services.



#### Property class

The property class, as it would be recognized in its local market. It is used to
categorize properties based on their quality, risk and potential income. This
can be input simply as 'A' or 'Class C'. Additional details can be added.


#### Listing summary

A summary sales description of the property to entice a buyer. The summary can
long and include information that highlights the use and opportunity of the
property.


### Property highlights

A sorted, bulleted list of property highlights, usually written by the selling
agent. These highlights do not need to be property facts and are often shown
in real estate listings after the summary of the property.


### Property facts

Property facts are a list of bullet point details that are known to be true,
often property specifications and zoning information, that contribute to the
valuation of the property.

Any number of property facts can be added to a property. Some common fact types
are explicitly defined by ReturnSuite. Any number of additional facts can be
added as needed.

Facts can be added, removed and reordered using controls on the form. The order
the facts are set will be the order they appear in reports and when they are
used. Facts with greater importance should be near the top.


##### Fact types:

Sale Type
:   The expected usage for the property by the buyer.
    Selectable types include: Investment, Investment or Owner Use, and Owner
    Use.

Building Size
:   The dimensions of a building in the selected area unit as a decimal.
    The selected area unit does not need to match the area unit of the model.
    Additional building dimensions can be added with additional info.

Year Built / Renovated
:   Either year the building was built or renovated or both. At least one value
    must be input if this fact is added.

Lot Size
:   The dimensions of the lot in the selected area unit as a decimal.
    The selected area unit does not need to match the area unit of the model.

Zoning
:   The zoning information of the building by the local government controlling
    how the property can be used. This should be as specific as possible.

Parking Spaces
:   The number of parking spaces to be input as either a number or text string.

Additional Info
:   A custom field. The name of the fact will be shown in reports instead of
    additional information, allowing multiple entries to be added. A value is
    required for each entry.
