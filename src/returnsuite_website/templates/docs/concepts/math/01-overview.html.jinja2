    <h2>Summary of the key math concepts used in finance</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
      The fundamental question financial analysts are trying to answer is ‘how
      much a future set of cash flows is worth today?’ In this section we are
      going to go over a handful of economic concepts and mathematical tools
      that are the fundamental building blocks for answering this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with, the overarching concept most financial analysis is based on
      is the <b>Time Value of Money</b>–that financial benefits available today
      are more valuable than equivalent benefits in the future. This is because
      money we forgo today can be invested and returned to us with interest at
      a later date, therefore a dollar today is worth more than a dollar a year
      from now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Time Value of Money leads us to the concept of cash flows not only
      needing an amount (ex. $1,000) but a timestamp (ex. $1,000 a year into
      the future).
    </p>
    <p>
      To distinguish between money or value today and at some point in the
      future we use the terms <b>Present Value</b> (the value today) and
      <b>Future Value</b> (the value at some point in the future). Much of
      finance and financial analysis involves moving cash flows either forwards
      or backwards in time so they can be consolidated into a single number.
      Most often this means converting Future Value cash flows to Present
      Values so they can be totalled and give us a <b>Net Present Value</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Discount Rates</b> or the <b>Cost of Capital</b> is the cost of
      converting a cash flow one point in time to another–whether it’s being
      converted from a Future Value to a Present Value, a Present Value to a
      Future Value or even from one Future Value to another Future Value.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will look at <b>Perpetuities</b> and the <b>Gordon Growth Model</b>
      which is the math valuing a continuous, never-ending set of cash
      flows–crucial for assessing the worth of long-term assets like property.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will also cover the concept of <b>Expected Value</b>, a statistical
      measure that forecasts the weighted average financial results from
      different investment scenarios. This is a valuable tool as there is often
      uncertainty about exactly what will happen in the future–will a tenant
      renew their lease or will their unit be placed back on the market–Expected
      Values allows us to factor this uncertainty into our modeling.
