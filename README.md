# GDPR Compliance

The tool https://2gdpr.com/ performs a cookie check on the website. This should pass cleanly.

In general:
- All metrics should be recorded anonymously server side. Some metrics are lost 
  but no need for a banner and improves page performance.
- YouTube embed links should not be used and instead thumbnails created and link 
  directly to the YouTube platform. This allows metric capture and ensures
  perfect compliance.
- Be careful with third party widgets.
